## Reflection:
  As someone who would not be able to take concentration-related courses(cybersecurity courses) until my Junior year in college, I decided to make use of this certificate this summer since it was free under UNCC! I am eternally grateful that this is an opportunity that UNCC and Coursera offers to our students as it feeds my desire to learn more about cybersecurity outside of classes and for the free. I was very surprised at how much information outside of programming there was when it came to the cybersecurity, as well as how there are many tools that make jobs easier such as SIEM tools or playbooks. This course built a strong foundation of knowledge on what the cybersecurity industry looks like and how complex each job may be, but it does not stop my never-ending curiousity for what the next courses will teach me next!
