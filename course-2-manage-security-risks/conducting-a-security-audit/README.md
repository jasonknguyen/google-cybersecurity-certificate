In this submodule of the course, I was able to conduct my own security audit for Botium Toys.

- After reading Scope, Goals, and Risk Assesment Report, I was able to check through the controls and compliance of Botium Toys' security and determine what they had and what they were lacking.
- When completed, I gave the proper recommendations to reduce their risk score and improve their cybersecurity posture while complying to standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR
