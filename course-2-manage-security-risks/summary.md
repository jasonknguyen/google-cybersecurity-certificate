- Playbooks

## Skills Gained:
- How to conduct a security audit from start to finish
- Knowledge on how to follow a playbook alongside SIEM tools

## Reflection:
This course was very short compared to the last course but that does not undermine the knowledge that I gained. This course took a deeper dive into how to follow compliance standards through carrying out security audits for an organization in order to make sure their security posture is up to par as well as to avoid fines. I also learned the many types of SIEM tools used in an organization including open-source tools, self-hosted tools, cloud-hosted tools, and hybrid tools. I appreciated this unit as it brought more clarity on what SIEM tools are and the many types that exist. I know that these are crucial for entry-level cybersecurity jobs and I hope to potentially learn more about them throughout this course.
